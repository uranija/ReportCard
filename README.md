# ReportCard
## Fifth project in ABND course
The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.
Your Java class should keep track of various grades. You can use character variables (e.g. char englishGrade = 'A';), String variables (e.g. String mathGrade = "A-";), integer variables (e.g. int historyGrade = 85;), or double variables (e.g. double biologyGrade = 90.5;) to keep track of grades.

The design is up to you. Your class needs to be able to keep track of grades, access them, and set them. It is recommended that you use getters and setters, which are methods which return and set specific variables. For example, if your class had an int variable called chemistryGrade, you might include methods such as


Methods like this allow another programmer to use your class without necessarily understanding all the variables inside. You will also need to implement a constructor.

The most important portion of your project will be the toString() method, which gives a human-readable String representing the data stored in the report card. 



An example return value might be a String like "Name: John Doe; English grade: A; History grade: B-; Math grade: B+;" and so on.
