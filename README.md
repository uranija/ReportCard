# ReportCard
## Fifth project in ABND course
The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.
Your Java class should keep track of various grades. You can use character variables (e.g. char englishGrade = 'A';), String variables (e.g. String mathGrade = "A-";), integer variables (e.g. int historyGrade = 85;), or double variables (e.g. double biologyGrade = 90.5;) to keep track of grades.

Project requirements:
- It is recommended that you use getters and setters, which are methods which return and set specific variables.
- Class needs to be able to keep track of grades, access them, and set them.
- Implementing a constructor.
- Using toString() method, which gives a human-readable String representing the data stored in the report card. 
- An example return value might be a String like "Name: John Doe; English grade: A; History grade: B-; Math grade: B+;" and so on.
